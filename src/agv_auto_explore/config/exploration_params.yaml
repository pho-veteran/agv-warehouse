    # Tugbot Industrial AGV Parameters
    # Optimized for large warehouse environments
    # Tugbot specs: 0.7m long, 0.56m wide, ~46kg
    # ==========================================================================
    
    # DBSCAN clustering - Larger tolerance for warehouse scale
    cluster_tolerance: 0.5        # meters - larger for warehouse frontiers
    min_frontier_size: 8          # minimum points to form a cluster
    
    # Safety margins - Tugbot is larger than TurtleBot3
    obstacle_clearance: 0.5       # meters - increased clearance for safety
    min_goal_distance: 1.2        # meters - increased to avoid getting stuck around blocks
    
    # Blacklist parameters - Warehouse scale
    blacklist_radius: 1.2         # meters - slightly larger for warehouse
    max_blacklist_size: 25        # auto-clear faster in large space
    
    # Adaptive exploration (late-stage)
    min_frontier_size_final: 3    # Find small frontiers at end
    adaptive_threshold: 0.70      # Adapt earlier for large warehouse
    
    # Information gain parameters
    information_gain_radius: 2.0  # meters - increased for better frontier selection
    scale_radius_with_map: true   # Scale radius based on map size
